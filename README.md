XBUP: eXtensible Binary Universal Protocol
==========================================

The XBUP Project aims to design and to provide an open-source support for unified general binary data representation format.

This should provide following advantages:

 * Advanced Data Structures - Unified structure should allow to combine various types of data together
 * Efficiency - Optional compression and encryption on multiple levels should allow effective representation of binary data
 * Flexibility - General framework should provide data transformations/processing and compatibility issues solving capability
 * Comprehensibility - Catalog of data types, metadata, relations and abstraction should allow better understanding of data
