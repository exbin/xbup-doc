====== Project Introduction ======

Project should provide universal protocol which should allow general methods for handling various types of data including:

  * **Multimedia Files** - Audio, Video, Animation
  * **Filesystem** - Allow to represent data of filesystem or as compressed archive
  * **Application API** - Remote or local methods execution supporting parameters and result passing

There should be It should provide single access method to all types of data and allow to combine them together.

The protocol is also intended to bring advantages of modern markup languages like XML into binary world. It's a ground-up designed alternative focused on binary data, yet providing similar techniques like XML Schema, XML Namespaces, XSLT and so on.

TODO

  * **Advanced Data Structures** - Unified structure should allow to combine various types of data together
  * **Flexibility** - General framework should provide data transformations/processing and compatibility issues solving capability
  * **Comprehensibility** - Catalog of data types, metadata, relations and abstraction should allow better understanding of data
  * **Efficiency** - Optional compression and encryption on multiple levels should allow effective representation of binary data

Some of the design principles:

  * Flexibility over efficiency
  * Abstraction over compactness
  * Evolving over simplified

Meaning / Strongly typed
  * Data should allow to define type, including:
  * number -> length in meters (unit)

Language Independent
