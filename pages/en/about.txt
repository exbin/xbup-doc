====== Project Introduction ======

Project should provide universal protocol which should allow general methods for handling various types of data including:

  * **Multimedia Files** - Audio, Video, Animation
  * **Filesystem Structure** - Allow to represent data of filesystem or as compressed archive
  * **Application API** - Remote or local methods execution supporting parameters and result passing
  * **Serialization Protocol** - Provide ability to serialize structured data
  * **Long-term data storage** - Provide way to define data with separate or integrated specification
  * **Huge data** - Use dynamic numeric values to allow support for data in terabytes range or more
  * **Representation of segmented, fragmented or indexed data**

The protocol is also intended to bring advantages of modern markup languages like XML into binary world. It's a ground-up designed alternative focused on binary data, yet providing similar techniques like XML Schema, XML Namespaces, XSLT and so on.

==== Design Principles ====

Project is using bottom-up approach with layers building on top of each other adding gradually new functionality.

Some of the design principles:

  * Flexibility over efficiency
  * Abstraction over compactness
  * Evolving over simplified
