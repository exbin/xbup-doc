====== Architecture and Principles ======

XBUP should be data protocol with unified data structure usable for both communication and file storage purposes. All data should be strongly typed and there should be meta-data definitions based on transformations.

Protocol itself should be based on the following principles:

  * Unlimited Number's Binary Encoding - [[en:doc:devel:progress:encoding|more about encoding]]
  * Simple Block-Tree Structure - [[en:doc:devel:progress:structure|more about structure]]
  * Strong Types - [[en:doc:devel:progress:types|more about types]]
  * Catalog of Types - [[en:doc:devel:progress:catalog|more about catalog]]
  * Data Transformations - [[en:doc:devel:progress:transform|more about transformations]]

===== Framework Architecture =====

Operating system independent framework for data processing and compatibility issues solving. Provides infrastructure for data streams processing as library or system service and support for various programming languages...

Basic service is based on SOA principles and includes module's repository and catalog database.
