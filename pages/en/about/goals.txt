====== Project Goals ======

[[this>?about/videos|Video presentation]] about project is recommended for the first time visitors.

The primary goal of this project is to create communication protocol/data format with the following characteristics:

  * **Universal** - Suitable for any type of data, persistent storage or streaming purposes
  * **Independent** - Not tightly linked to particular spoken language or infrastructure/programming language
  * **Flexible** - Support for data transformations, compatibility and extensibility
  * **Effective** - Data compactness and compression support for plain binary and structured data

===== Protocol Design =====

Protocol design should cover following areas:

  * **Data structure** - How to store/stream data
  * **Data types** - Declaration of data types and build-in types
  * **Data transformations** - Support for data transformations, like compression, encryption and so on

===== Prototype Implementation =====

Free and open source prototype implementation in Java is currently underway. It should provide following outputs:

  * **Basic library** - Library providing support for handling data encoded in the protocol itself
  * **Catalog of types** - Catalog service providing access to declaration of types
  * **Framework** - Local service providing various functions for applications
  * **Editor tool** - Basic tool for viewing and edition
  * **Sample applications and files** - Applications and files for demonstration purposes
