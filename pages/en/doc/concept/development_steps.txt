====== Concept: Development Steps ======

As XBUP project is technically an experimental/research initiative without clearly defined outcome, bottom-up iterative prototyping approach was chosen as preferable development method.

===== Development Cycle ======

Goal is to provide prototype implementation supporting desired properties, with repetitive sequence of steps:

**Extend/refine set of requirements -> analyze and design improved solution -> implement new / modify existing functionality -> testing / validation -> provide prototype release**

Typically only last release and currently developed version are covered by runable environment (database, catalog and framework service).

On the end of each cycle, prototype should be evaluated regarding the project requirements and new set of requirements for next cycle should reflect existing conflicts.

===== Growing Functionality ======

Bottom-up approach is step-by-step extending set of requirements from most simple requirements to more advanced features. Possible list might include:

  * Number Encoding
  * Block Structure
  * Typing System
  * Catalog
  * Data Transformations
  * Data Meaning & Constraints
  * Scripting

See [[en:doc:concept|project concepts]] to read more about those properties/functionality.
