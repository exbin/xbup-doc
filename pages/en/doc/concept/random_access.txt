====== Concept: Random Access Acceleration ======

FIXME

The RAT technique (Random Access Table) reduces the access time in the processing of the document. Allows you to find a block more effectively while reading the document.

==== Solution Details ====

It uses ancillary table with a list ancillary blocks and direct links to them. References are given as the addresses using a block of bits relevant to current size of the block. Considered aspects:

  * Where to place - you can put this table anywhere in the document, but there are various problems associated with that
    * At the beginning - A problem with the need to move data while the increase or updating data
    * At the end - How to find the end
  * Which items to address - you can choose the items using various ways
    * All subitems - big size of table
    * Only the offspring of the selected level
    * Completely optional items - how to addressed?
  * What information to include in order to accelerate
