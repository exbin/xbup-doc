== Universal Data Protocol

Representation of any possible data with focus on abstraction.

Primary principles:

Tools: Provide viewer / editor capable to work with the data at ease
Provide human friendly alternative methods when possible including textual syntaxes / markup languages and graphical visualisations when possible.

Use of separate layers / modules should allow rapid simultaneous and independent development of various parts of the project by multiple teams at the same time.

== Data Processing Framework

Provide automatic and manual data transformations. Usable for data protocol for automatic conversion of data and data types. 

Ability to form processing clusters and support multiple programming languages and diversive environment.

* Data-flow or service operations

* Ability to combine multiple operations into complex ones

* Possibly visual designer

== Programming Language

Algorithms and data structures represented using universal protocol. Better structure for machine processing including refactoring or general transformations / updates. (independent of tool / IDE)

Aim is to provide language which could be converted (compiled, transputed) into as many enviroments as possible.

Allow to convert to and from other programming languages.

* Multilevel
  
  Increment of the CPU register including flags:
     IO parameters as register and flags
  Bus signals to output bus in number of ticks
  
  up to:
  
  assign more servers to cloud node/cluster

* Operation isolation

* Deterministic
  or specified with non-deterministic inputs (like network or random number generator)

* Can specify input/output conditions, complexity or other resources requirements like time and space/memory
  
== Database System

* Data represented using protocol - fields as binary blob records
* Query engine built on top of transformation framework
* Support for programming concepts
* Not transactional or relational per se, but
* Structure of data and all abilites can be dynamically defined
* Same for caches / indexes
* Support for clustering of multiple database machines

Examples:

* Single table made from multiple parts split by date - Recent records would have more indexes / caches for faster processing
* Cache for number of records of given type for faster processing
* For structured binary or text fields ability to index their values beyond text indexing
* Support for fields computed using transformation programming language
* Structure definition stored in machine processible form - allow to transform structure of data

== Knowledge Base Repository

Knowledge stored using previously mentioned technologies.

Additional metadata defines further relations between abstract entities and ontologies
