1  Introduction

   The Extensible Binary Universal Protocol (XBUP) is a general purpose
   binary data protocol and file format with primary focus on
   abstraction.

   Key features:

    *  Unified block-tree structure - Minimalistic core structure based
   on integer and blobs only

    *  Build-in and custom data types - Data type definitions and
   catalog of types

    *  Transformations framework - Data transformation and compatibility
   handling

   Primary focus on abstraction makes this protocol somewhat different
   compare to other similar binary formats which focus on efficiency,
   serialization or binary representation of mark-up language, like for
   example

1.1  Objectives

   The primary goal of this project is to create communication
   protocol/data format with the following characteristics:

     * Universal - Capable to represent any type of data, suitable for
   persistent and long-term storage and streaming

     * Independent - Not tightly linked to particular spoken language or
   infrastructure, processing architecture or programming language

     * Declarative - 

     * Effective - Data compactness and compression support for plain
   binary and structured data

     * Flexible - Support for data transformations, compatibility and
   extensibility

1.2  Terminology

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
